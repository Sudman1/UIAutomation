    UIAutomation

SHORT DESCRIPTION
    A simple wrapper for the UI Automation functionality exposed by the
    System.Windows.Automation namespace.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    This module makes some simple capabilities from the Microsoft UI
    Automation .Net library easily accessible to PowerShell users.

    All UI controls are considered AutomationElements. The top-level
    AutomationElement is the desktop. The desktop contains windows which,
    in turn, contain controls.

    This module honors that conceptualization and provides commands to
    get the root element (Get-UIRoot), get a list of window objects
    (Get-Window), and get a list of a window's controls (Get-Control).

    The contents of text controls, such as labels and text boxes can be
    retrieved with the Get-UIText function and set with the Set-UIText
    function.

    Finally, to click a button, use Invoke-UIControl.
